Joogwang Lim is a Boston-based, South Korean composer. His main musical features can be summarized as a fusion between music and other ideas, such as myths, stories, plays, religious texts, ideologies, and even scientific theories. Especially, plots extracted from these ideas play an important role in his music. Along with his tendency of composing firm and complex structures from those plots, his music contains full of expressive components, such as texts, symbols, leitmotifs, and even theatrical and aleatory motions. In addition to that, he continues to reach a wide variety of genres, i.e. choral music to traditional Korean music, to express his diverse cultural, material and spiritual experiences.

Anti-bio
Cited as "the most uninteresting composer" (by his non-musician friends), Joogwang Lim, born in 1992 in South Korea, is known for composing music that is notoriously difficult to perform, often demanding technical virtuosity from musicians for nothing. In his music, Joogwang Lim eschews traditional harmonic conventions, opting for dissonance and unconventional chord progressions. He challenges the concept of traditional phrasing, creating music that may seem disjointed and unpredictable, yet often fails to achieve his initial goals. 

Throughout his career, Lim has embraced a diverse range of musical ideas and styles, resulting in compositions that lacks a cohesive stylistic thread. His composition led to numerous rejections from various competitions, commissions, and opportunities. Lim's compositions have received only a handful of awards and recognition. He has had limited exposure at festivals, and scholarships and financial support have been scarce. In most cases, Lim's compositions received no reviews at all. Rarely his work left critics and audiences uncertain of how to interpret or categorize it, leading to polarizing responses; even his father scolded him by presenting a game controller in his music. Furthermore, a large volume of his works is yet to be premiered, limiting opportunities for public recognition and performance. 

In recent years, Joogwang Lim has faced creative challenges, finding it difficult to produce new compositions in his slothful manner under the guise of the so-called “process of stylistic transformation.” 
After venturing to the United States to pursue further studies and opportunities, Lim encountered additional obstacles as a foreigner and faced uncertainty in finding stable employment within the challenging music industry. Even though he expects to earn a doctoral degree in music and plans to end the twenty-five years of studentship, Joogwang Lim's journey as a professional composer has been far from smooth and stable.
